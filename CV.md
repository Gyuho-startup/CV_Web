Founder-in-training and Psychology undergraduate at Coventry University with hands-on experience in early-stage problem discovery, user research, and lean validation. I focus on getting close to users to identify real problems before building solutions, using surveys, interviews, and live feedback as early PMF signals. My background spans student-facing systems, community experiments, and low-budget market validation under real-world constraints.

## EXPERIENCE & PROJECTS

### SYSTEM — Founder  
Coventry University | Jan 2025 – Present

- Presented SYSTEM in a **live public feedback session** with founders and mentors to challenge assumptions and refine the problem definition.
- Treated surveys, interviews, and live critique as early PMF signals rather than validation, iterating problem framing before committing to solutions.
- Guided by the belief that **closer proximity to users leads to better product decisions**, prioritising direct feedback over assumption-driven design.
